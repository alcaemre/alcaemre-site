{"/":{"title":"alcaemre.com","content":"\nSometimes I wonder what the ancient humans thought as they looked at the motions of the stars--as they told their myths of gods and heroes immortalized in the constellations.  These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and thus all they could do was wonder and create stories. I can imagine the explanation we, today, have for these lights in the sky--that they are burning balls of gas unimaginable distances away--would feel as improbable to them as their description feels to us.\n\nA part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].\n\n![murmuration of starlings](images/7uUb.gif)\n\nThis is a murmuration of starlings--this flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.\n\nEmergent systems have a certain kind of intoxicating magic to them. Once you are aware of their existence, emergent patterns become ever-present. Every living system, every mountain range--even the cracking of sand--exhibits emergent behavior. Often the same patterns appear in seemingly disparate places as well. The Voronoi pattern emerges in drying mud, the structure of dragonfly wings and leaves, as well as the camouflage patterns of giraffes.\n\n![voronoi patterns](images/voronoi-patterns.png)\nCan you describe this pattern? The presence of it is very clear, but what actually describes its structure? I find that emergent patterns always seem to be easy to notice, but are quite difficult to describe. I think this perceptual effect is what gives emergent patterns their allure. They trigger the same pattern recognizing parts of the brain that have us find shapes of animals in the clouds, or the constellations themselves, but these patterns are real (or seem to be more real than constellations or cloud-animals). They captivate wonder, but I don't think studying emergence will deromanticize them in the way that the stars have been (in that any star being near any other in our sky is purely coincidental). \n\nStrangely enough, I was initially exposed to the concept of emergence in a course on philosophy of mind. The sense in which it was presented was:\n\n**\u003e If we assume there is no 'magic' to the mind, then consciousness must emerge from the interaction of neurons similarly to a tornado emerging from the interaction of warm and cool wind currents.**\n\nMost theories of mind in classical philosophy are dependent on some nonmaterial 'soul' or 'spirit' controlling the material body, making this approach seem very pragmatic and grounded in comparison. While the emergentist view of consciousness is based in science, it has been treated a lot like magic--just scientific magic. \n\nI was not so quickly satisfied.\n\nThe validity of the claim is obvious in the same way that the shape of the murmuration is obvious, but just because you can notice the pattern does not mean you can describe it. This sparked my formal interest in physics. \n\nWhile this question of the emergence of consciousness is what started my interest in physics, it is a question that is much too large to undertake as a project--and I think claiming to undertake it as an undergraduate would be deeply naive. If, by the end of my career, I have a good formulation of that question, I will die very satisfied. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-16T17:50:43.305189888Z","tags":null},"/articles/computational-irreducibility":{"title":"Computational Irriducibility","content":"Coming soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)","lastmodified":"2022-09-16T17:50:43.305189888Z","tags":null},"/articles/eidos-and-form":{"title":"The Eidos: Forms and Essences","content":"\nComing soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms)","lastmodified":"2022-09-16T17:50:43.305189888Z","tags":null},"/articles/emergence-of-objects":{"title":"On the Emergence of Ontologies","content":"\u003eHow does sensory information become abstract thought?\n\nWhat is the physical phenomena that brings about abstract thought?\n\n  \n\nThis appears like an [[jargon/ontology|ontological]] question but it is rather the question of *the emergence of ontology itself*. This makes it not only a philosophical question, but a deep scientific question as well. \n\n  \n\nAs I have explored this question more and more, it has become increasingly clear that it demands a polymathic attitude. The parts are so disparite but so close. This project is meant to be a semi-formal exploration of the project of rigorously studying the emergence of ontologies. \n\n  \n\nI expect I will be wrong left right and center, and that my perspective will change as more work is done and as I am able to do more of my own work.
