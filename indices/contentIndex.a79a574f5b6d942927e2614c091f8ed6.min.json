{"/":{"title":"alcaemre.com","content":"\nHello and welcome to my site dedicated to my making sense of the interdisciplinary web that is the study of complex systems. \n\nIf you are new here, I would highly recommend you read my [[articles/mission-statement|mission statement]] so that you can have a decent idea of what I am about.\n\n# Projects:\n## Doing vs. Being\nIn Cognitive Science at least, [[jargon/Functionalism|Functionalism]] has been the stance used to define minds for a long time--that to be a mind is to be capable of what minds do. Dretske says that mind must have the capacity to represent information, but also misrepresent information. Others say that a systesm must be able to attribute mental states, or perform some judgement of relevance realization (i.e. the intelligent ignoring of the vast majority of information) to be a mind. \n\n[Aman Bhargava](https://aman-bhargava.com/) and I have been considering another notion: what if functionalism is looking at the problem at the wrong level. Most minds that are discussed, be that human minds, animal minds, or the collective mind of an ant colony (an example I will often use), they [[jargon/emergence|emerge]] from the interaction of large numbers of discrete parts--akin to a murmuration of starlings. The intuition or thesis is that two systems that exhibit the same emergent behavior are comprised of parts that follow analagous rules. That it is not the mental states that must have a functional lens put on them, but the neuron, or the ant.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop this stance, pulling from Philosophy of Mind, Mathematics and Computation, Shannon Information, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics. \n\nAman and I believe that this notion holds true not only for the creation of minds, but the engineering of any [[jargon/Complex System|complex system]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.764439594Z","tags":null},"/articles/computational-irreducibility":{"title":"Computational Irriducibility","content":"Coming soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.764439594Z","tags":null},"/articles/eidos-and-form":{"title":"The Eidos: Forms and Essences","content":"\nComing soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms)","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.764439594Z","tags":null},"/articles/emergence-of-objects":{"title":"On the Emergence of Ontologies","content":"\u003eHow does sensory information become abstract thought?\n\nWhat is the physical phenomena that brings about abstract thought?\n\n  \n\nThis appears like an [[jargon/ontology|ontological]] question but it is rather the question of *the emergence of ontology itself*. This makes it not only a philosophical question, but a deep scientific question as well. \n\n  \n\nAs I have explored this question more and more, it has become increasingly clear that it demands a polymathic attitude. The parts are so disparite but so close. This project is meant to be a semi-formal exploration of the project of rigorously studying the emergence of ontologies. \n\n  \n\nI expect I will be wrong left right and center, and that my perspective will change as more work is done and as I am able to do more of my own work. Topics will be written about and returned to.

These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and thus all they could do was wonder and create stories. I can imagine the explanation we, today, have for these lights in the sky--that they are burning balls of gas unimaginable distances away--would feel as improbable to them as their description feels to us.\n\nA part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].\n\n![murmuration of starlings](images/7uUb.gif)\n\nThis is a murmuration of starlings--this flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.\n\nEmergent systems have a certain kind of intoxicating magic to them. Once you are aware of their existence, emergent patterns become ever-present. Every living system, every mountain range--even the cracking of sand--exhibits emergent behavior. Often the same patterns appear in seemingly disparate places as well. The Voronoi pattern emerges in drying mud, the structure of dragonfly wings and leaves, as well as the camouflage patterns of giraffes.\n\n![voronoi patterns](images/voronoi-patterns.png)\nCan you describe this pattern? The presence of it is very clear, but what actually describes its structure? I find that emergent patterns always seem to be easy to notice, but are quite difficult to describe. I think this perceptual effect is what gives emergent patterns their allure. They trigger the same pattern recognizing parts of the brain that have us find shapes of animals in the clouds, or the constellations themselves, but these patterns are real (or seem to be more real than constellations or cloud-animals). They captivate wonder, but I don't think studying emergence will deromanticize them in the way that the stars have been (in that any star being near any other in our sky is purely coincidental). \n\nStrangely enough, I was initially exposed to the concept of emergence in a course on philosophy of mind. The sense in which it was presented was:\n\n**\u003e If we assume there is no 'magic' to the mind, then consciousness must emerge from the interaction of neurons similarly to a tornado emerging from the interaction of warm and cool wind currents.**\n\nMost theories of mind in classical philosophy are dependent on some nonmaterial 'soul' or 'spirit' controlling the material body, making this approach seem very pragmatic and grounded in comparison. While the emergentist view of consciousness is based in science, it has been treated a lot like magic--just scientific magic. \n\nI was not so quickly satisfied.\n\nThe validity of the claim is obvious in the same way that the shape of the murmuration is obvious, but just because you can notice the pattern does not mean you can describe it. This sparked my formal interest in Physics. \n\nBut my formal training in physics has left many gaps, and has very few opportunities to explore these genuine questions, especially those without clear answers.\n\nThe purpose of this cite is to give me a space to develop projects that have connections to many seemingly disparate parts, consider them on their own, and integrate them.\n\nThese projects often start with questions from Cognitive Science, but have effects that span Physics, Mathematics, Computation, as well as Sociology, Philosophy, and have the visceral beauty that is often only present in Visual Art.","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.764439594Z","tags":null},"/jargon/Complex-System":{"title":"Complex System","content":"A complex system has behavior that is [[emergence|emergent]] from its constituent parts","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.804440373Z","tags":null},"/jargon/Functionalism":{"title":"Functionalism","content":"\nFunctionalism is the notion that the hardware that a mental state runs on is not important, only the role it plays in the larger cognitive system is of consequence.","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.804440373Z","tags":null},"/jargon/chaos":{"title":"chaos","content":"Chaos is a high degree of sensitivity to initial conditions.\n\nTo read more see the backlinks or its definition and description in the article on [[articles/computational-irreducibility|computational irreducibility]] ","lastmodified":"2022-09-27T18:00:18.804440373Z","tags":null},"/jargon/emergence":{"title":"Emergence","content":"Parts become whole.
