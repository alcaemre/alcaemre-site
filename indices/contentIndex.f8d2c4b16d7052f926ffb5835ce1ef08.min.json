{"/":{"title":"alcaemre.com","content":"\nHello and welcome to my site dedicated to my exploration of the interdisciplinary web that is the study of complex systems. \n\nIf you are new here, I would highly recommend you read my [[articles/mission-statement|mission statement]] so that you can have a decent idea of what I am about. To understand my approach to writing I would direct you towards my other meta-articles like [[articles/on-humility|On Humility]]. \n\n# Projects:\n## Doing vs. Being\nIn Cognitive Science at least, [[jargon/Functionalism|Functionalism]] has been the stance used to define minds for a long time--that to be a mind is to be capable of what minds do. Dretske says that mind must have the capacity to represent information, but also misrepresent information. Others say that a systesm must be able to attribute mental states, or perform some judgement of relevance realization (i.e. the intelligent ignoring of the vast majority of information) to be a mind. \n\n[Aman Bhargava](https://aman-bhargava.com/) and I have been considering another notion: what if functionalism is looking at the problem at the wrong level. Most minds that are discussed--be that human minds, animal minds, or the collective mind of an ant colony (an example I will often use)--[[jargon/emergence|emerge]] from the interactions between large populations of discrete parts. \n\nThe central intuition of this project is that any two systems that exhibit the same emergent behavior are comprised of parts that interact in ways that are described by analagous rules. That it is not the mental states that must have a functional lens put on them, but the neuron, or the ant.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop this stance, pulling from Philosophy of Mind, Mathematics and Computation, Shannon Information, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics. \n\nAman and I believe that this notion holds true not only for the creation of minds, but the engineering of any [[jargon/Complex System|complex system]]. \n\u003e The first article on the topic will be released on October 19, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/articles/Instrumentality-and-the-Extended-Mind":{"title":"Instrumentality and the Extended Mind","content":"\n\u003e This is the outline for a short presentation I gave on September 30, 2022 for PHY340: Issues in Philosophy of Mind at the University of Toronto, taught by Dr. Daniel Munroe\n\nIn [*The Extended Mind*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3328150) Clarke and Chalmers argue that the tools that augment cognition are not only extensions of the mind, but should be regarded as a part of the mind itself. They use the example of a person playing Tetris™, who uses the the rotation of the shapes not to *position* the tetronimo, but to *determine* whether the tetronimo is compatible with a particular position. The rotation function of the game is *doing cognitive work* for the player. This determinative (i.e. cognitive, non-physical) action is referred to as an *epistemic* action--it aids and augments cognitive processes\". This is in contrast to *pragmatic* actions, which change things in the physical world. Clarke and Chalmers believe that epistemic actions deserve epistemic credit.\n\nThis is their notion of *active externalism*--that external cognitive processes are still cognitive, and should be considered a part of the mind. That a person connected with some external cognitive augmentation becomes a *coupled system* where the cognitive processes of the person become subject to the causes and constraints--the form--of the external system.\n\nMuch of their paper is concerned with address the issue that these coupled systesm may be too easily *decoupled*. Clarke and Chalmers try to resolve this issue by saying that the potential for decoupling does not damage the theory, since these external systems become a part of the mind when they become so reliably coupled to us that they become \"part of the package of cognitive resources that [we] bring to bear on the everyday world\" (11).\n\nClarke and Chalmers further support this claim with the notion of prosthetic memory. They describe Inga, who hears about an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Knowing that the MoMA is on 53rd Street, she walks there and visits the museum. They contrast Inga's experience with that of Otto, who has Alzheimer's disease. Otto has learned to use a notebook to act as the part of his cognitive system that stores information like the location of the MoMA. Otto may not know where to go to see this exhibition, but as long as Otto has his notebook to refer back to, he is just as capable of finding the MoMA as Inga is. Otto and his notebook, as a coupled system, are functionally equivalent (at least constrained to the task of navigating to the MoMA) as Inga is.\n\nThis notion of technology acting augmenting the mind, both in the sense of doing cognitive work and in altering the kind of work the mind can do, is all too familiar today. Smartphones act as a map, compass, encyclopedia, calculator, and the most sophisticated notebook coinceivable to Clarke and Chalmers in the 90's. The notion that cognition can be extended is all but irrefutable.\n\nWhere I struggle to follow Clarke and Chalmers is in the distinction between epistemic and pragmatic action. The article itself introduces these terms but sort of glosses over them. The example of epistemic action used is the Tetris player using the \"rotate\" function to see if a tetronimo fits in a particular place rather than performing the rotation mentally. Clarke and Chalmers' example of a pragmatic action is the plugging of a hole in a dam. These examples are not very helpful, so lets consider some new ones.\n\nLet's imagine a mathemetician who writes equations on a chalkboard to be able to track his algebra. Take the chalkboard away, and now the algebra is much more difficult. The chalkboard acts as a kind of prosthetic memory, augmenting the person's ability to do math. There is epistemic work being done by the chalkboard to aid in the doing of math--the act of holding the previous equation is an epistemic action.\n\nNow lets imagine carpenter who uses a hammer and nails and wood to build houses. There is pragmatic work being done by the nails that hold the pieces of the house together. \n\nThe issue that I have is that any pragmatic action is facilitated some epistemic action--the use of tools to do work is afforded by the  way that they extend the mind. The cliche even is 'when all you have is a hammer, everythign is a nail'. Tools change the way we interact with the world. That being said, I struggle to say that tools become a part of the mind when we use them, or use them so regularly that we feel as though we are missing something without them.\n\nIf we take away the hammer away from a craftsman, they cannot do their work. But have we removed a part of their body? I would hesitate to say yes.\n\nLet's go further. Say someone breaks their leg, and while their leg is in a cast, they must use crutches to walk. If we take away their crutches, have we taken away a part of their body? I would still hesitate to say yes.\n\nWhere it really gets muddy is when we speak of a person with a prosthetic limb. If we remove the limb, have we removed part of the body? In this case I would still hesitate to say yes, but I would be more sympathetic with the notion that we have.\n\nIf we say no to these points, how can we rightly say that we remove part of the mathematician's mind if we remove his chalkboard, or remove part of Otto's mind when we remove his notebook?\n\nAs I see it, there are prosthetics and there are augmentations. Prosthetics replace or offload existing cognitive functions. Augmentations afford new cognitive functions. I believe this is true regardless of whether the body or the mind is the thing that is being directly extended. The hammer acts as an extension of the arm when it is held, but it also afford the mind new methods of constructing physical structures. Therefore pragmatic actions are only afforded by the epistemic action of the tools that facilitate them.\n\nThis creates an important dilemmma. If Clarke and Chalmer's stance that epistemic actions deserve epistemic credit is maintained, then any distinction between the mind and world dissolves, and the distinction loses any meaning. On the other hand, the notion of extension cannot be eliminated. \n\nThis is the discussion question. Are prosthetics a part of the self? Where should we draw the line between mind an world? Between body and not-body","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/articles/mission-statement":{"title":"My Compass","content":"Sometimes I wonder what ancient humans thought as they looked at the motions of the stars--as they told their myths of gods and heroes immortalized in constellations.  These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and thus all they could do was wonder and create stories. I can imagine the explanation we, today, have for these lights in the sky--that they are burning balls of gas unimaginable distances away--would feel as improbable to them as their description feels to us.\n\nA part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].\n\n![murmuration of starlings](images/7uUb.gif)\n\nThis is a murmuration of starlings--a flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.\n\nEmergent systems have a certain kind of magic to them. Once you are aware of their existence, emergent patterns become ever-present. Every living system, every mountain range--even the cracks that form in the drying of mud--exhibit emergent behavior. Often the same patterns appear in seemingly disparate places. The Voronoi pattern emerges in drying mud, the structure of dragonfly wings and leaves, as well as the camouflage patterns of giraffes.\n\n![voronoi patterns](images/voronoi-patterns.png)\nCan you describe this pattern? The presence of it is very clear, but what actually describes its structure? I find that emergent patterns always seem to be easy to notice, but are quite difficult to describe. They trigger the same pattern recognizing parts of the brain that have us find shapes in the clouds or constellations in the stars, but these patterns are real (or seem to be more real than constellations or cloud-shapes). They captivate wonder, but I don't think studying emergence will deromanticize them in the way that the placement of stars have been (in that any star being near any other in our sky is purely coincidental). \n\nStrangely enough, I was initially exposed to the concept of emergence in a course on philosophy of mind. The sense in which it was presented was:\n\n**\u003e If we assume there is no 'magic' to the mind, then consciousness must emerge from the interaction of neurons, similar to a tornado emerging from the interaction of warm and cool wind currents.**\n\nMost theories of mind in classical philosophy are dependent on some nonmaterial 'soul' or 'spirit' controlling the material body, making this approach seem very pragmatic and grounded in comparison. While the emergentist view of consciousness is based in science, it has been treated a lot like magic--just scientific magic. \n\nI was not so quickly satisfied.\n\nThe validity of the claim is obvious in the same way that the shape of the murmuration is obvious, but just because you can notice the pattern does not mean you can describe it. I began to look to methods of studying these emergent systems. The philosophy was sound, but this theory of emergence seemed to be the place in this argument that has the most room for growth. \n\nThe purpose of this cite is to give me a space to develop projects that have connections to many seemingly disparate parts, consider them on their own, and integrate them.\n\nThese projects often start with questions from Cognitive Science, but have effects that span Physics, Mathematics, Computation, as well as Sociology, Philosophy, and have the visceral beauty that is often only present in Visual Art.","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/articles/on-humility":{"title":"On Humility","content":"\n# Why Did I Make This Site?\n\nIn the spring of 2020, I began to take the question 'how does mind emerge from matter' quite seriously. I was taking Prof. John Vervaeke's Introduction to Cognitive Science, and John is excellent at making convoluted discussions incredibly enticing. The question that was the most salient to me was not one of the necessary and sufficient conditions for mindedness, or the most simple functional form of cognition (although these are very interesting topics), it was *how mind emerges from matter.*\n\n\u003e There is nothing in an ant that describes the colony\n\nThe Cognitive Science program at the University of Toronto (UofT) has a very strong philosophical background and lots of support for students to explore cognition from a philosophical perspective. Professors Jim John and John Vervaeke are very approachable and very kind to their students. There is also significant access to work in artificial intelligence, as UofT is home to Geoffrey Hinton and the titanic Vector Institute. \n\nBut my central interest was not in philosophy or in computation. My interest is motivated by questions in both fields, but I am skeptical that the answers to those questions are likely to be answered be the contemporary approaches to these fields.\n\nMy central interest seemed to be in complex systems--in [[jargon/emergence|emergent systems]]. Systems where the whole is literally greater than the sum of its parts. There is nothing in an ant alone that describes the colony. The colony only exists as it emerges out of the interaction between thousands of ants. Prof. Vervaeke especially was happy to support and encourage this approach to cognitive science papers and more philosophical writing (which I am very grateful for), but I wanted to study emergence from a more empirical perspective. \n\nI put quite a lot of effort into considering what field I should study in alongside cognitive science to enable me to study emergent systems with my career. For the questions that I'm interested in, the most natural choice would be biology, but the truth of [Jsomers' *I Should Have Loved Biology*](https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/) dissuaded that approach.\n\nThe most natural next choice was physics. I tended to be sympathetic to the theories of mind that modelled cognition as a dynamical system--as a series of interacting feedback loops, like [Alicia Juarrero's *Dynamics in Action*](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3793/Dynamics-in-ActionIntentional-Behavior-as-a). \n\u003e\"Unlike the processes described by classical thermodynamics, which in their relentless march towards equilibrium forget their past, complex adaptive systems are essentially historical. They embody in their very structure the conditions under which they were created (including the chance events around which each self-organized stage reorganizes). The unrepeatable, random fluctuation or perturbation around which each phase of a sequence of adaptations nucleates leaves its mark on the specific configuration that emerges.\" (Juarrero, 9)\n\nJuarrero's book is really what convinced me to study physics. She was always working towards an Aristotelian metaphor for a kind of cognitive dynamics, but it was one of those theories that seem utterly obvious as the argument progresses--as if it was a tautology from its premises. I was convinced that the connection was more than metaphorical.\n\nTwo years (and some) later, and I have learned many very useful skills and very interesting concepts. My algebra is drastically improved, and I have a whole new lens of beauty for symmetry, for fluid dynamics, and for mathematical modelling in general. As thankful as I am for all of that, emergence has only ever been mentioned in my coursework once. It was with regard to the diffusion of molecules of a solute in some solvent as a collection of random walkers. Often when I mention emergence. I have struggled quite a bit to find supervisors and mentors in emperical complexity science. Of course, it is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic has also made working with external professors much more difficult.\n\nAfter years of waiting, of learning and preparing to be able to empirically study the dynamics of complex systems, I have decided to make the opportunity to study these systems for myself. The purpose of this site is to house those explorations.\n\n# On Humility\nSince I am performing most of this study on my own, I need to be quite careful with regard to how I speak, as it must not be too authoritative. I will be exploring intuitions quite genuinely. I will likely find my intuitions to be incorrect, and that's a large part of the point. I want this site to be a record of my progression. I hope I often find my intuitions to be wrong, since that means I'm learning.\n\nI think there is something very interesting that comes with developing a concept, realizing its flaws, and iterating further. This iteration is a part of the scientific process that is not often highlighted. Writing about the ways that scientists are grossly wrong 10 times before coming upon a reasonable theory. I can only aim to exemplify and encourage this kind of healthy self-skepticim.\n\nAll of this is to say that I must approach this work with humility. That around all corners, I will likely be the fool. I hope that by the end of a project, I will be less of one. But to do this, I must also write with inegrity--with a clear sense of self-skepticism, absolutely--but I must explore and write about what my genuine intuitions are, and then change my positon in lew of new evidence.\n\nI can only hope that you, my reader, will come along for the ride--and perhaps join the discussion!","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/drafts/computational-irreducibility":{"title":"Computational Irriducibility","content":"Coming soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/drafts/eidos-and-form":{"title":"The Eidos: Forms and Essences","content":"\nComing soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms)","lastmodified":"2022-10-17T04:01:16.040044673Z","tags":null},"/drafts/emergence-of-objects":{"title":"On the Emergence of Ontologies","content":"\u003eHow does sensory information become abstract thought?\n\nWhat is the physical phenomena that brings about abstract thought?\n\n  \n\nThis appears like an [[jargon/ontology|ontological]] question but it is rather the question of *the emergence of ontology itself*.

The fact that the judge must pick the computer to be a more likely candidate to be human than the real human person reminded me of the motto of the *Tyrell Corporation* of Blade Runner (1982) (the company responsible for the design and production of replicants--artificial humans): \"More human than human\".\n\nIn Blade Runner, there is something analogous to the Turing test--the Voight-Kampff test. But the Voight-Kampff test is not a test of language, rather a test of empathy. These replicants have already mastered language, since they are physically artificial humans, and thus have the same capacities we have--but they are made as adults, lacking emotional experience. \n\nTyrell plays a sort of imitation game further, where an experimental replicant is implanted with artificial memories and becomes vastly more difficult to identify as a replicant.\n\nDespite the film's age, I think it points at a distinctly modern issue with the use of the Turing test. As there are more and more computational systems with real competency with natural language, we must reconsider the role of the Turing Test.\n\nI agree with Dennett when he says that the purpose of the Turing test is not to define what it is to have a mind, but rather that if a system can pass the Turing test, its competence as a cognitive agent is worth further consideration (2002). \n\nWhat I think Dennett (and Turing, since Denett is just a clearer description of Turing's original thesis) is gesturing at is a gradient of intelligence. The Voight-Kampff test seems like a natural next step of whether a system is worthy to be considered to have personhood. They evidently have real intelligence, but do they have real emotional capacities?\n\nOf course, Blade Runner is really a film about slavery and xenophobia. We can make these tests, and discuss whether something is deserving of the consideration of a person, but it you watch the film, it is clear that the replicants exhibit a lot more humanity than the 'real' humans do.\n\nDennett, D.
