{"/":{"title":"alcaemre.com","content":"\nSometimes I wonder what the ancient humans thought as they looked to the motions of the stars--as they told their myths of gods and heroes immortalized in the constellations. I imagine that the explanation that these lights in the sky are burning balls of gas sitting unimaginable distances away similarly unlikely to their mythologies. These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and so they wondered. Time passed the the motions of the stars became less mysterious.\n\nA part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].\n\n![murmuration of starlings](notes/images/7uUb.gif)\n\nThis is a murmuration of starlings--a flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.\n\nEmergent systems have a certain kind of intoxicating magic to them. One you are aware of their existence they become inescapable. Every living system, every mountain range, even the cracking of sand, exhibit emergent behavior. Not only that, but one seeming characteristic of emergent patterns is that they are very easy to notice, but very difficult to describe.\n\n{insert image of voronoi patterns here}\n\nMy interest in emergence started as a metaphysical one: [[articles/emergence-of-objects|how does abstract thought emerge from sensory information entering the brain?]]\n\n\u003e ...still in progress...","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T03:04:46.736147698Z","tags":null},"/articles/computational-irreducibility":{"title":"Computational Irriducibility","content":"Coming soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T03:04:46.736147698Z","tags":null},"/articles/eidos-and-form":{"title":"The Eidos: Forms and Essences","content":"\nComing soon, for now I defer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms)","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T03:04:46.736147698Z","tags":null},"/articles/emergence-of-objects":{"title":"The Question of the Emergence of Ontologies","content":"\nThe question that began this journey into complex systems science is a bit of strange one.\n\n\u003e *When I am looking at a glass on a table, there is some light that refracts off of it that just so happen to be absorbed by my eye and turned into neuronal impulses. How do these impulses turn into the thought of the object that is good at holding liquid?*\n\n\nOr, more succinctly:\n\n\u003eWhat is the physical phenomena that brings about abstract thought?\n\n  \n\nThis appears like an [[jargon/ontology|ontological]] question but it is rather the question of *the emergence of ontology itself*. This makes it not only a philosophical question, but a deep scientific question as well. \n\n  \n\nAs I have explored this question more and more, it has become increasingly clear that it demands a polymathic attitude. The parts are so disparite but so close. This project is meant to be a semi-formal exploration of the project of rigorously studying the emergence of ontologies. \n\n  \n\nI expect I will be wrong left right and center, and that my perspective will change as more work is done and as I am able to do more of my own work. Topics will be written about and returned to. The shape of the project will ebb and flow as we explore this magical snake that eats in own tail, as she crosses through philosophy, to biology, to physics, to computation, to sociology, to the art world and beyond. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nLet's begin this journey with a discussion of the [[articles/maximally-presice-language|bounds of what we can study presicesly]].","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T03:04:46.736147698Z","tags":null},"/articles/maximally-presice-language":{"title":"Edmund Husserl: What are We Able to Study Rigorously?","content":"\nThere is a powerful irony in our project.
