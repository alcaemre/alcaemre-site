### important points
1. strong software skills, and skills working as a part of a software team
2. experience developing automated lab
3. highly adaptable, can step into projects in unfamiliar fields and parse out the important parts of the problem to his goals, excellent at working with chemistry experts and transferring their experimental procedures to procedures the robots can excecute.
5. highly flexible, finds creative and pragmatic (as well as time and cost efficient) solutions to problems
6. leadership/mentor to other students

1.  Start by explaining your relationship to the candidate. 
	- I met Emre in October 2020, after receiving emails from multiple other faculty members of the Chemistry department of University of Toronto about a very capable, and very non-standard student. After chatting with Emre, I invited him to join my group.
1. Include long you've known the candidate.
	- Emre joined the matter lab in November 2020 and was a part of the group for 16 months.
2.  Add positive personal qualities with specific examples.
	- Highly flexible, finding creative, pragmatic, and efficient solutions to flexible problems
		- In this time proved to be a very capable software developer, efficient team member, and excellent at finding creative solutions to implementation problems. On a project for finding optimal conditions for liquid dispensing, he had to weigh out each set of conditions by hand. Instead of continuing to do this, he found a way to put a standard analytical balance inside the robot so that the machine learning could recommend conditions, conduct experiments, and receive results without any human intervention. This solution saved the group hundreds of man-hours (relative to continuing to measure by hand) or thousands of dollars (if a proprietary balance was acquired rather than a standard one). Emre excels at finding similarly flexible solutions to the final kinks in closed-loop workflows.
	- Highly adaptable to unfamiliar fields, excellent at collaborating with experts in those fields and parsing out the parts of a problem relevant to automation.
		- Another of Emre's responsibilities was to take the experiments the chemists were performing by hand and implement a workflow that performed the same experiment on robotic platforms. I was impressed with Emre's ability to work with the experimental chemists in the group. Despite his lack of background in chemistry, he was able to efficiently communicate with the chemist and implement their procedures on our robotic platforms very quickly. 
	- Leadership/mentorship
		- Emre also showed great leadership in his time in the group. He worked with other students brought into the group, taking them from not having any background in python to being readily able to develop new workflows on the systems he helped develop to directly control the robots.
1.  Close with a statement of recommendation.
	- Overall, Emre was a pleasure to have in my group. His abilities in software development, creative problem-solving, and ability to work well within a team makes him a great candidate for just about any work. With his experience working in my lab, he is an excellent candidate to develop your automated laboratory.

RE: Emre Alca

I met Emre in October 2020, after receiving emails from multiple other faculty members of the Chemistry department of University of Toronto about a very capable, and very non-standard student. After chatting with Emre and seeing his natural scientific capability, I invited him to join my group. Emre joined the matter lab in November 2020 and was a part of the group for 16 months.

In this time proved to be a very capable software developer, efficient team member, and excellent at finding creative solutions to implementation problems. On a project for finding optimal conditions for liquid dispensing, he had to weigh out each set of conditions by hand. Instead of continuing to do this, he found a way to put a standard analytical balance inside the robot so that the machine learning could recommend conditions, conduct experiments, and receive results without any human intervention. This solution saved the group hundreds of man-hours (relative to continuing to measure by hand) or thousands of dollars (if a proprietary balance was acquired rather than a standard one). Emre excels at finding similarly flexible solutions to the final kinks in closed-loop workflows.

Another of Emre's responsibilities was to take the experiments the chemists were performing by hand and implement a workflow that performed the same experiment on robotic platforms. I was impressed with Emre's ability to work with the experimental chemists in the group. Despite his lack of background in chemistry, his flexibility and character were phenomenal. He was able to efficiently communicate with the chemists and implement their procedures on our robotic platforms very quickly and effectively. 

Emre also showed great leadership in his time in the group. He worked with other students brought into the group, taking them from not having any background in python to being readily able to develop new workflows on the systems he helped develop to directly control the robots.

Overall, Emre was a pleasure to have in my group. His abilities in software development, creative problem-solving, and ability to work well within a team makes him a great candidate for just about any work. With his experience working in my lab, he is an excellent candidate to develop your automated laboratory.
