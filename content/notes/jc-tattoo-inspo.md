## Placement
I'm thinking on my right arm or right leg. I'd be very interested in pieces that work well with motion, preferably spanning two joints.

## Previous tattoos

These are tattoos that are of the style I'd be interested in (I wanted to embed the images, but Instagram is being painful with how to retrieve links to images)

>	this piece has a lot of fine detail work, which I'm tempted by, since it gives room for some of the self-organizing patters discussed below

	I also absolutely love when the leaves twist around themselves and make helicies, like this example

## Forms from Complexity: Self-Similarity and Self-Organization

One hallmark of self-organized systems, or moments of spontaneous order is self-similarity. Essentially, this means that there is some fractal behavior present. An example of this is the mandelbrot set.

You can see that as the image zooms in, the structure of the pattern is maintained. Similar happens with a Koch Curve.

Many living systems exhibit self-similar behavior. This is a romenesco cauliflower

Notice that the small knobs exhibit the same behavior as the whole head of the cauliflower, and the knobs on each knob follow that same pattern as well. 

Another famous example of self-similarity in plants is in ferns. This is a mathematical diagram called the Barnsley Fern.

Real ferns are self-similar in slightly less perfect ways, but still self-similar. Here are some examples

![fiddlehead-2.jpeg](images/fiddlehead-2.jpeg) 

Not only the central branch coils up, but also the smaller 'leaf' branches as well. This image is not particularly fractal, but demonstrates this leaf-coiling well.

Here is a photo of a fern that I took in pacific spirit park, near my home in Vancouver. Notice how the leaves are little ferns in themselves.

Or, also in my neighborhood at home, the branches of trees exhibit fractal branching patterns

Lichens also exhibit some of the most incredible fractal behavior. This is another example found on the underside of a tree in Vancouver.

![van-lichen.jpg](images/van-lichen.jpg)

Or, in much more incredible fashion, these are lichens from Meare's island close to Tofino, one of the last untouched old growth forests in Canada. These lichens are likely hundreds of years old

At this level, they really start to take alien form, like plants from a different planet.

I'm absolutely not expecting all (or any) of these fractal points to end up in my tattoo. If it could, I think it would be super cool, but I also imagine it would take a lot of work. I got a little carried away once I started looking into it, but I think it super cool and pretty.
