# Blade Runner's Voight-Kampff test and the Turing Test

Let's recall that the Turing Test is an imitation game--for a computer to convince a human judge to pick a human to be a computer rather than the computer itself. The fact that the judge must pick the computer to be a more likely candidate to be human than the real human person reminded me of the motto of the *Tyrell Corporation* of Blade Runner (1982) (the company responsible for the design and production of replicants--artificial humans): "More human than human".

In Blade Runner, there is something analogous to the Turing test--the Voight-Kampff test. But the Voight-Kampff test is not a test of language, rather a test of empathy. These replicants have already mastered language, since they are physically artificial humans, and thus have the same capacities we have--but they are made as adults, lacking emotional experience. 

Tyrell plays a sort of imitation game further, where an experimental replicant is implanted with artificial memories and becomes vastly more difficult to identify as a replicant.

Despite the film's age, I think it points at a distinctly modern issue with the use of the Turing test. As there are more and more computational systems with real competency with natural language, we must reconsider the role of the Turing Test.

I agree with Dennett when he says that the purpose of the Turing test is not to define what it is to have a mind, but rather that if a system can pass the Turing test, its competence as a cognitive agent is worth further consideration (2002). 

What I think Dennett (and Turing, since Denett is just a clearer description of Turing's original thesis) is gesturing at is a gradient of intelligence. The Voight-Kampff test seems like a natural next step of whether a system is worthy to be considered to have personhood. They evidently have real intelligence, but do they have real emotional capacities?

Of course, Blade Runner is really a film about slavery and xenophobia. We can make these tests, and discuss whether something is deserving of the consideration of a person, but it you watch the film, it is clear that the replicants exhibit a lot more humanity than the 'real' humans do.
