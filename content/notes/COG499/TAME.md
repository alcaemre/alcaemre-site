### Introduction

- All cognitive agents are collective intelligences
- cognition is not only self reflexive advanced cognition or metacognition, but also recognizes adaptive responsiveness and actions of different levels of sophistication
	- creates a continuum of cognitive sophistication, giving rise to an *axis of persuadability* 
	- #### What is the axis of persuadability? What is its relationship with the intentional stance?
		- "Persuadabilty refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given systemâ€™s behavior." (4)

### Cognition: Changing the Subject

- "The embodied nature of cognition means that mental Selves are dependent on a highly plastic material substrate which changes not only on evolutionary time scales but also during the lifetime of the agent itself." (5)
	- the Self is subject to significant change in real time
	- this can be slow, more ordinary change, or can be a more radical change in material (e.g. memories can be maintained from before and after the liquification of the caterpillar brain)
- what are invariants that enable a self to persist?
	- Memories?
		- but memories can be transferred between individuals by way of brain tissue implants or other molecular engrams
		- memories are really communication between past and future Selves--biological bodies are made up of cells that die, are born and significantly rearrange, thus questions of how cognition can persist are questions of swarm dynamics rather than purely stable structures or programs
	- #### check back on [42; 43; 44; 45] for what sensory substitution is
- Hybrots (hybrid robots and animals) plates of neurons can learn how to fly a flight simulator [53; 54; 55]

### Philosophical Foundations of an Approach to Diverse Intelligences

- a commitment to gradualism with respect to all important cognition-related properties
	- there is no true clear line that demarcates 'true cognition' from 'just physics'
- example of issue: bilogically evolved froms have intrinsic motivation while software AI agents are only faking it *via functional performance*
	- but do fish or single cells or mitochondria *actually care*? 
	- if we make hybrids of robots and cells how many cells does the system need before that living system's 'true' cognition extends to the whole system?
- There is no privileged material substrate for Selves
