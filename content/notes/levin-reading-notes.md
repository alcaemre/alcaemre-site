# The Biophysics of Regenerative Repair Suggests New Perspectives on Biological Causation (M. Levin, 2020)
- Anatomical “macrostates” can be implemented by a wide range of molecular and cellular arrangements and even time-series trajectories that all implement the same large-scale outcomes.[5–7]
- Artificial Life in silico and in vitro[15]
- It is impossible here to do justice to the rich literature on causation in biology, and philosophically inclined readers are invited to delve deeper.[11,14,21–35]
- [relevant causation is] a mechanism or event is the cause of some outcome when it provides the most efficient way for experimenters, or the biological system itself, to induce it to occur, prevent it from occurring, or modify how it occurs.
- There has been a rich debate in philosophy and science about the nature of causation,[6,8,12,13]
- Any set of components will give rise to some emergent electrical pattern (akin to turing pattern self-organization from a homogenous substrate[80]), but if the components and their connectivity map has been subject to selection, it will give rise to electrical dynamics that are robust, process inputs into useful outputs, and in some cases can even implement memory (subsequent activity is modified by past experiences or input signals)
- genetic descriptions belief that morphodynamics are based on linear gene expression
	- this should lead to errors propogating downstream
- these errors in fact reduce in frequency downstream
	- the model must be incomplete
- behaviors are not based on states of local environment
	- if you graft the tail of salamander onto the place where a tail should be, it slowly turns into an arm
- picasso tadpoles
	- even if you put all the parts of a tadpole in the wrong place, they take unorthodox paths towards the correct position as they metamorphasize into frogs
		- morphology is not a linear execution of experiements, but rather governed by attractors seeking stable states
			- via dynamical systems theory
- [A teleological] perspective offers an important and practical strategy for bioengineers: re-writing the stored setpoint (and letting un-modified cells build to that new specification), instead of attempting to micromanage (re-wire) individual cell interaction rules, hoping emergence of desired largescale outcomes.

- how are you giving the cells instructions???

### Introduction
- all cognitive agents are collective intelligences
- cognition is not only self reflexive advanced cognition or metacognition, but also recognizes adaptive responsiveness and actions of different levels of sophistication
	- creates a continuum of cognitive sophistication, giving rise to an *axis of persuadability* 
	- #### What is the axis of persuadability? What is its relationship with the intentional stance?
		- "Persuadabilty refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior." (4)
### Cognition: Changing the Subject
- "The embodied nature of cognition means that mental Selves are dependent on a highly plastic material substrate which changes not only on evolutionary time scales but also during the lifetime of the agent itself." (5)
	- the Self is subject to significant change in real time
	- this can be slow, more ordinary change, or can be a more radical change in material (e.g. memories can be maintained from before and after the liquification of the caterpillar brain)
- what are invariants that enable a self to persist?
	- Memories?
		- but memories can be transferred between individuals by way of brain tissue implants or other molecular engrams
		- memories are really communication between past and future Selves--biological bodies are made up of cells that die, are born and significantly rearrange, thus questions of how cognition can persist are questions of swarm dynamics rather than purely stable structures or programs
	- #### check back on [42; 43; 44; 45] for what sensory substitution is
- Hybrots (hybrid robots and animals) plates of neurons can learn how to fly a flight simulator [53; 54; 55]
### Philosophical Foundations of an Approach to Diverse Intelligences
- a commitment to gradualism with respect to all important cognition-related properties
	- there is no true clear line that demarcates 'true cognition' from 'just physics'
- example of issue: bilogically evolved froms have intrinsic motivation while software AI agents are only faking it *via functional performance*
	- but do fish or single cells or mitochondria *actually care*? 
	- if we make hybrids of robots and cells how many cells does the system need before that living system's 'true' cognition extends to the whole system?
- There is no privileged material substrate for Selves
