# The Biophysics of Regenerative Repair Suggests New Perspectives on Biological Causation (M. Levin, 2020)
- Anatomical “macrostates” can be implemented by a wide range of molecular and cellular arrangements and even time-series trajectories that all implement the same large-scale outcomes.[5–7]
- Artificial Life in silico and in vitro[15]
- It is impossible here to do justice to the rich literature on causation in biology, and philosophically inclined readers are invited to delve deeper.[11,14,21–35]
- [relevant causation is] a mechanism or event is the cause of some outcome when it provides the most efficient way for experimenters, or the biological system itself, to induce it to occur, prevent it from occurring, or modify how it occurs.
- There has been a rich debate in philosophy and science about the nature of causation,[6,8,12,13]
- Any set of components will give rise to some emergent electrical pattern (akin to turing pattern self-organization from a homogenous substrate[80]), but if the components and their connectivity map has been subject to selection, it will give rise to electrical dynamics that are robust, process inputs into useful outputs, and in some cases can even implement memory (subsequent activity is modified by past experiences or input signals)
- genetic descriptions belief that morphodynamics are based on linear gene expression
	- this should lead to errors propogating downstream
- these errors in fact reduce in frequency downstream
	- the model must be incomplete
- behaviors are not based on states of local environment
	- if you graft the tail of salamander onto the place where a tail should be, it slowly turns into an arm
- picasso tadpoles
	- even if you put all the parts of a tadpole in the wrong place, they take unorthodox paths towards the correct position as they metamorphasize into frogs
		- morphology is not a linear execution of experiements, but rather governed by attractors seeking stable states
			- via dynamical systems theory
- [A teleological] perspective offers an important and practical strategy for bioengineers: re-writing the stored setpoint (and letting un-modified cells build to that new specification), instead of attempting to micromanage (re-wire) individual cell interaction rules, hoping emergence of desired largescale outcomes.
