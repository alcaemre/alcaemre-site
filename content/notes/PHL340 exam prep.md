	- treat study exam like a take home test
	- think critically about the content, like where to object
## Artificial Intelligence and the Mind
### What are the main theories of consciousness we encountered in the course?
- what are the theories of consciousness
	- Block
		- Higher Order theory
			- a mental state is conscious when it has a higher order though
			- global workspace
				- a mental state is conscious when it is held in a global workspace that other subsystems of the mind can access
		- Dahane wants to integrate these two
			- when you lose either of these you also lose phenomenal consciousness
		- Block wants to reject both of these and argue for consciousness is a biological process
			- study the parts of the brain that give rise to consciousness to reduce consciousness to a physical process
		- Chalmers
			- property dualism
				- mental properties cannot be fully explained by physical properties
		- Descartes is a substance dualist
			- consciousness is distinct from the physical
- **arguments??**
### How can we know if an entity is conscious? What sorts of evidence do we have? Does our evidence differ for humans vs. computers? (readings directly discussing these Qs: Turing, Chalmers’ ch. 15).
- Turing
	- behaviors: the Turing test
- Chalmers hard problem
	- we don't just observe behaviors, we observe behaviors and see that they are correlated with our own consciousness
	-  its always possible that the other is a zombie, but this is not a bad inductive process for determining whether a thing is conscious
		- for computers we can only use behaviour and this is just weaker evidence
	- the most rigorous way for me to know whether a computer can have consciousness would be to upload my consciousness into a computer
		- how would one do this and ensure that they retain their consciousness?
			- chalmers says gradual uploading
- **arguments???**
## The Extended Mind Hypothesis
### What is the Extended Mind Hypothesis? How do Clark and Chalmers argue for it by appealing to the Parity Principle?
- Extended Mind Hypothesis
	- coupling
		- two systems are not closely coupled unless the external system is relied on as if it was an equivalent system internal to the human
	- parity principle
		- if a process is considered cognitive when it occurs in the head, it should be considered cognitive when it occurs outside the head
	- active externalism
		- if a process is considered cognitive when it occurs in the head, it should be considered cognitive when it occurspartially outside the head
	- The extended mind
		- if the mind is the cognitive apparatus, when a 
### What are Cognitive Offloading and Transactive Memory? How do these notions relate to the Extended Mind Hypothesis?
- cognitive offloading
	- use of physical action to alter the information processing requirements of a task to reduce cognitive demand
	- there's something oxymoronic about calling this a 'reduction of cognitive demand' if the parts of the world that are being offloaded to are to be considered cognitive as well
	- can offload to the body or the world
		- you can count with your fingers
		- you can put information in a notebook
- transactive memory
	- specific example of cognitive offloading
	- knowledge that is distributed across two or more individuals
		- human to human or human to object
		- the coupled system knows more than the person knows alone
### What are Gertler’s two main objections to the Extended Mind Hypothesis? (one about introspection; one about people performing actions they didn’t actually perform).
- Introspection
	- we can introspect our own mental states, but otto cannot introspect on his own notebook
		- introspection is inherently first-personal 
			- as soon as more than one person can access your mental states, they are no longer-first personal
				- if mental states are made as the combination of qualitative and intentional content, then the correct first-personal account is only reconstructed when Otto is reading his notebook
- Performing actions 
	- if you program Otto's intentions into a robot (e.g. to make banana bread), and otto goes to sleep
		- show that this is counterintuitive
			- the crown is the king's will
## Virtual Reality and the Mind
### What does Chalmers mean when he says virtual worlds are just as “real” as physical reality? How does he draw a distinction between physical and digital objects?
- objects in virtual worlds are not 'fictional objects' in the way that a sword from Lord of the Rings is. They are 'real objects'.
- we can interact with them in the same way
	- we can perceive objects in virtual world in the same way as things in the world (we can see them)
	- we can manipulate them
	- they can affect us
- Fictional objects are different
	- I cannot literally wield a sword from lord of the things in the actual world of the books
	- there is no way that I can interact with any object in the lord of the rings books that changes the way that characters act. They do the things that are written on the page no matter what *I* do
	- especially in a book rather than a movie 
- causal powers
	- what it is for something to be an object in the real world is for them to be able to interact with other objects

### What is mind/body dualism, and why does Chalmers think virtual realities give rise to a form of mind/body dualism?
- when hooked up to a virtual reality, you have a dualistic relationship to the body in the virtual world 
	- the body in the virtual world is controlled by a thing not made of virtual substances
- therefore, if it is plausible that we are living in a simulation (i.e. a virtual world) dualism itself is plausible


### According to Ramirez et al., how do developers of VR simulations try to enhance empathy through “nudges”? How do Ramirez et al. appeal to the notion of semantic variance to argue that it’s impossible to know what it’s like to experience the world as someone very different from you?
- VR simulations are for enhancing empathy through 'nudging'
	- a nudge is a feature of the environment that can shape behavior
		- must be subtle, not blatant, pushing for unconscious changes
	- Ramirez cares about educative nudges
		- especially towards understanding what It's like to be another person
			- especially marginalized populations: disabled people, people of colour, homeless people, but it is impossible to really understand what it is like to be another person
				- this is because of semantic variance

- semantic variance
	- your past experiences dictate the way you interpret future events
		- if you have never experienced racial discrimination, the way you will interpret discriminatory experiences will be different than those who have experienced racial discrimination

## Does Technology Manipulate Us?

### What does Nguyen mean when he says Twitter gamifies communication and changes our communicative goals and values? 
(You should be able to explain Nguyen’s notions of value clarity and value capture, including some non-social media examples.)
- value clarity
	- taking an activity that have complex goals and values and replacing them with quantified, simple values
		- the goal of going to school is to learn and understand things, but grades replace them with a score
		- twitter replaces the complex goals of communication with likes and retweets and replies
			- this replacement is a gamification of communication
- value capture is the replacement of your complex values with the gamified values even outside of the game space (i.e. twitter)

### In what sense does Munro think internet trolling is a kind of exploratory behaviour? How is this meant to explain why trolling behaviours tend to escalate and become increasingly extreme?
(You should be able to explain the distinction between exploration and exploitation, including non-trolling examples of each. You should be able to explain Munro’s view about how trolls eschew the knowledge norm of assertion.)
- exploration vs. exploitation
	- exploitation involves using existing knowledge to take advantage of known reward
		- high predictability of outcomes
	- exploration involves seeking new sources of reward
		- low predictability of outcomes
		- greater potential rewards in new forms of reward
	- this can happen in the social world
	- 
- when conversations act predictably, that's because they follow norms
	- e.g. knowledge norm of assertion
		- say true things
	- trolls violate the KNA to provoke emotional responses
		- this is a form of exploration to see how people would react to these surprising situations.

### What does Madary mean when he claims our digital devices create illusions of agency, and how does he think such illusions arise?
(You should be able to explain one or two specific examples of both digital and non-digital illusions of agency.)
- Illusions of agency
	- agency: being in control of your actions
	- different from 'sense of agency' which is the feeling of being in control of your actions
		- usually these two go together
	- in illusions of agency, you have the sense of agency without actual agency
	- sense of agency occurs when there is predictability and fluency
	- there can be these things without actual agency
	- apps are designed to give a sense of agency while making their use as habitual and automatic as possible (i.e. removing agency)
