# What does *Doing vs. Being* Claim?

The purpose of this article is to understand what *Doing vs. Being* is claiming. Many of the details of this argument will have their own articles, where their nuances will be thoroughly explored.

The central claim of *Doing vs. Being* is that *if two systems display the same emergent behavior, they are homomorphism of one another.* This is a very non-trivial claim, which makes it difficult for me to call it a hypothesis or a theory. For now, it is just an intuition. I aim to explore its validity together with you, the reader, as it develops in these articles.

# What is a Homomorphism?
The concept of a homomorphism was introduced to me by my nonlinear dynamics instructor. This was less of a technical introduction, but rather to motivate what it means to do physics. 
If a physicist want to study some parts of the world, they must create some theory where the relationship between those parts are the same in the theory as they are in the world. The homomorphism is the structure preserving function that maps from theory to reality.

A very important feature of homomorphisms in the kernel. The kernel contains all parts of reality that do not effect the relationships with which we are concerned. The real skill of a physicist. according to this particular instructor, is deciding what you must retain, and what you may discard.

# Different Mechanics, Same Dynamics
- A ball in a parabolic bowl is described by the same EoM as a planet orbiting a 

# Homomorphic Reclationships Between Emergent Systems
- If two systems exhibit the same emergent dynamics, they must be homomorphisms of one another

# Analog Computers and Emergent systems
- If there are homomorphic relationships between emergent systems, we should be able to use lower-level instantiation of an emergent patter to simulate the dynamics of a higher level instantiation of the same pattern

# Compression, Least-Action Principles, and the Intentional Stance
- this stance seperates us from being beholden to lower level physics and allows us to be concerned purely with the rules of interaction rather than chemical or physical mechanisms. 
	- the mechanics of locomotion of ants is likely in the kernal of the colony
- the relevant interactions can be simulated in virtual feedback cycles that likely can also be engineered
- to make a synthetic brain, we don't need to re-engineer neurons from scratch, we only need to make little robots that interact in a way that is homomorphic to the rules of the neurons of our brians.
