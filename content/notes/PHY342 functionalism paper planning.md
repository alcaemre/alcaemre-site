# What is functionalism? 

- "Functionalism is the philosophy of mind based on the distinction that computer science draws between a system's hardware, or physical composition, and its software, or program. The psychology of a system such as a human being, a machine or a disembodied spirit does not depend on the stuff the system is made of (neurons, diodes, or spiritual energy) but on how that stuff is organized. Functionalism does not rule out the possibilty, however remote it may be, of mechnaical and ethereal systems having mental states and processes." (Fodor, 118)
- "Functionalism is comitted to defining mental states in terms of their causes and effects" (Fodor, 122)


# According to functionalism, what are beliefs and desires?
- Andrew in tutorial
	- To believe that B = to stand in a certain relationship to a mental symbol in your brain that stands for B.
	- Fodor thinks that cognition is the chugging though of symbol operations in the language of thought.
- "The traditional view in the philosophy of mind has it that mental states are distinguished by their having what are called either qualitative content or intentional content." (Fodor, 122)
	- Qualitative content is experiential content. If an image is viewed through a red filter and then a blue filter, something about how that experience *feels* changes.
		- Functionalism does not account for this, since there is seemingly no consistent causal relationship between input and qualitative experience
			- thus functionalism does not account for consciousness.
	

# Can functionalism account for the intentional content of beliefs?
- "To say that a mental state has intentional content is to say that it has certain semantic properties." (Fodor, 122)
	-  "There is at least one kind of thing other than a mental state that has intentional content: a symbol." (Fodor, 122)
- Use Dretske
	- "The idea behind this proscription of intentional ingredients seems to be that since what we are trying to build-a thought-is an intentional product, our recipe cannot use intentional ingredients." ... "This, it seems to me, is a mistake, a mistake that has led some philosophers to despair of ever finding a naturalistic recipe for the mind." (Dretske 470)
		- intentional products are to the mind what copper is to an amplifier
			- "What we are trying to understand, after all, is not intentionality, per se, but the mind. Thought may be intentional, but that is not the property we are seeking a recipe to understand." (Dretske 470)

# Is it possible for a non-human machine to believe the very same thing as you. i.e. to have a belief that has the same intentional content as one of your beliefs?

- "An important tendency in cognitive science is to treat the mind chiefly as a device that manipulates symbols. If a mental process can be functionally defined as an operation on symbols, there is a Turing machine capable of carrying out the computation and a variety of mechanisms for realizing the Turing machine. (Fodor, 120)"
- "Associating the semantic properties of mental states with those of mental symbols is fully compatible with the computer metaphor, because it is natural to think that a computer as a mechanism that manipulates symbols. A computation is a causal chain of cemputer states and the links in the chain are operations on semantically interpreted formulas in a machine code. To think of a system (such as the nervous system) as a computer is to raise questions about the nature of the code in which it computes and the semantic properties of the symbols in the code. In fact, the analogy between minds and computers actually implies the postulation of mental symbols. There is no computation without representation" (Fodor, 122)

It seems the last of these points is the real essay question, it just requires that you consider the functionalist viewpoint.
