In [*The Extended Mind*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3328150) Clarke and Chalmers argue that the tools that augment cognition are not only extensions of the mind, but should be regarded as a part of the mind itself. They use the example of a person playing Tetrisâ„¢, who uses the the rotation of the shapes not to *position* the tetronimo, but to *determine* whether the tetronimo is compatible with a particular position. The rotation function of the game is *doing cognitive work* for the player. This determinative (i.e. cognitive, non-physical) action is referred to as an *epistemic* action--it aids and augments cognitive processes". This is in contrast to *pragmatic* actions, which change things in the physical world. Clarke and Chalmers believe that epistemic actions deserve epistemic credit.

This is their notion of *active externalism*--that external cognitive processes are still cognitive, and should be considered a part of the mind. That a person connected with some external cognitive augmentation becomes a *coupled system* where the cognitive processes of the person become subject to the causes and constraints--the form--of the external system.

Much of their paper is concerned with address the issue that these coupled systesm may be too easily *decoupled*. Clarke and Chalmers try to resolve this issue by saying that the potential for decoupling does not damage the theory, since these external systems become a part of the mind when they become so reliably coupled to us that they become "part of the package of cognitive resources that [we] bring to bear on the everyday world" (11).

Clarke and Chalmers further support this claim with the notion of prosthetic memory. They describe Inga, who hears about an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Knowing that the MoMA is on 53rd Street, she walks there and visits the museum. They contrast Inga's experience with that of Otto, who has Alzheimer's disease. Otto has learned to use a notebook to act as the part of his cognitive system that stores information like the location of the MoMA. Otto may not know where to go to see this exhibition, but as long as Otto has his notebook to refer back to, he is just as capable of finding the MoMA as Inga is. Otto and his notebook, as a coupled system, are functionally equivalent (at least constrained to the task of navigating to the MoMA) as Inga is.

This notion of technology acting augmenting the mind, both in the sense of doing cognitive work and in altering the kind of work the mind can do, is all too familiar today. Smartphones act as a map, compass, encyclopedia, calculator, and the most sophisticated notebook coinceivable to Clarke and Chalmers in the 90's. The notion that cognition can be extended is all but irrefutable.

Where I struggle to follow Clarke and Chalmers is in the distinction between epistemic and pragmatic action. The article itself introduces these terms but sort of glosses over them. The example of epistemic action used is the Tetris player using the "rotate" function to see if a tetronimo fits in a particular place rather than performing the rotation mentally. Clarke and Chalmers' example of a pragmatic action is the plugging of a hole in a dam. These examples are not very helpful, so lets consider some new ones.

Let's imagine a mathemetician who writes equations on a chalkboard to be able to track his algebra. Take the chalkboard away, and now the algebra is much more difficult. The chalkboard acts as a kind of prosthetic memory, augmenting the person's ability to do math. There is epistemic work being done by the chalkboard to aid in the doing of math--the act of holding the previous equation is an epistemic action.

Now lets imagine carpenter who uses a hammer and nails and wood to build houses. There is pragmatic work being done by the nails that hold the pieces of the house together. 

The issue that I have is that any pragmatic action is facilitated some epistemic action--the use of tools to do work is afforded by the  way that they extend the mind. The cliche even is 'when all you have is a hammer, everythign is a nail'. Tools change the way we interact with the world. That being said, I struggle to say that tools become a part of the mind when we use them, or use them so regularly that we feel as though we are missing something without them.

If we take away the hammer away from a craftsman, they cannot do their work. But have we removed a part of their body? I would hesitate to say yes.

Let's go further. Say someone breaks their leg, and while their leg is in a cast, they must use crutches to walk. If we take away their crutches, have we taken away a part of their body? I would still hesitate to say yes.

Where it really gets muddy is when we speak of a person with a prosthetic limb. If we remove the limb, have we removed part of the body? In this case I would still hesitate to say yes, but I would be more sympathetic with the notion that we have.

If we say no to these points, how can we rightly say that we remove part of the mathematician's mind if we remove his chalkboard, or remove part of Otto's mind when we remove his notebook?

As I see it, there are prosthetics and there are augmentations. Prosthetics replace or offload existing cognitive functions. Augmentations afford new cognitive functions. I believe this is true regardless of whether the body or the mind is the thing that is being directly extended. The hammer acts as an extension of the arm when it is held, but it also afford the mind new methods of constructing physical structures. Therefore pragmatic actions are only afforded by the epistemic action of the tools that facilitate them.

This creates an important dilemmma. If Clarke and Chalmer's stance that epistemic actions deserve epistemic credit is maintained, then any distinction between the mind and world dissolves, and the distinction loses any meaning. On the other hand, the notion of extension cannot be eliminated. 

This is the discussion question. Are prosthetics a part of the self? Where should we draw the line between mind an world? Between body and not-body
