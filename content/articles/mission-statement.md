Sometimes I wonder what ancient humans thought as they looked at the motions of the stars--as they told their myths of gods and heroes immortalized in constellations.  These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and thus all they could do was wonder and create stories. I can imagine the explanation we, today, have for these lights in the sky--that they are burning balls of gas unimaginable distances away--would feel as improbable to them as their description feels to us.

A part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].

This is a murmuration of starlings--a flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.

Emergent systems have a certain kind of magic to them. Once you are aware of their existence, emergent patterns become ever-present. Every living system, every mountain range--even the cracks that form in the drying of mud--exhibit emergent behavior. Often the same patterns appear in seemingly disparate places. The Voronoi pattern emerges in drying mud, the structure of dragonfly wings and leaves, as well as the camouflage patterns of giraffes.

Can you describe this pattern? The presence of it is very clear, but what actually describes its structure? I find that emergent patterns always seem to be easy to notice, but are quite difficult to describe. They trigger the same pattern recognizing parts of the brain that have us find shapes in the clouds or constellations in the stars, but these patterns are real (or seem to be more real than constellations or cloud-shapes). They captivate wonder, but I don't think studying emergence will deromanticize them in the way that the placement of stars have been (in that any star being near any other in our sky is purely coincidental). 

Strangely enough, I was initially exposed to the concept of emergence in a course on philosophy of mind. The sense in which it was presented was:

**> If we assume there is no 'magic' to the mind, then consciousness must emerge from the interaction of neurons, similar to a tornado emerging from the interaction of warm and cool wind currents.**

Most theories of mind in classical philosophy are dependent on some nonmaterial 'soul' or 'spirit' controlling the material body, making this approach seem very pragmatic and grounded in comparison. While the emergentist view of consciousness is based in science, it has been treated a lot like magic--just scientific magic. 

I was not so quickly satisfied.

The validity of the claim is obvious in the same way that the shape of the murmuration is obvious, but just because you can notice the pattern does not mean you can describe it. I began to look to methods of studying these emergent systems. The philosophy was sound, but this theory of emergence seemed to be the place in this argument that has the most room for growth. 

The purpose of this cite is to give me a space to develop projects that have connections to many seemingly disparate parts, consider them on their own, and integrate them.

These projects often start with questions from Cognitive Science, but have effects that span Physics, Mathematics, Computation, as well as Sociology, Philosophy, and have the visceral beauty that is often only present in Visual Art.
