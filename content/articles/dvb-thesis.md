# What does *Doing vs. Being* Claim?

The purpose of this article is to understand what *Doing vs. Being* is claiming. Many of the details of this argument will have their own articles, where their nuances will be thoroughly explored.

The central claim of *Doing vs. Being* is that *if two systems display the same emergent behavior, they are homomorphism of one another.* This is a very non-trivial claim, which makes it difficult for me to call it a hypothesis or a theory. For now, it is just an intuition. I aim to explore its validity together with you, the reader, as it develops in these articles.

# What is a Homomorphism?
The concept of a homomorphism was introduced to me by my nonlinear dynamics instructor. This was less of a technical introduction, but rather to motivate what it means to do physics. 
If a physicist want to study some parts of the world, they must create some theory where the relationship between those parts are the same in the theory as they are in the world. The homomorphism is the structure preserving function that maps from theory to reality.

> Fig. 1: Consider a homomorphism $h$, which maps from $G$ to $H$. $h$ maps all possible $aN$ into $\text{im}h$ (the image of $h$), maintaining the relationships between all $a$ in $aN$. All other parts of $G$ are collapsed into the *kernel* $(N=\text{ker}h)$. [Image Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism) 

A very important feature of homomorphism in the kernel. The kernel contains all parts of reality that do not affect the relationships with which we are concerned. The real skill of a physicist, according to this particular instructor, is deciding what you must retain and what you may discard.

# Homomorphic Relationships Between Physical Systems

Homomorphic relationships do not only exist as maps between theory and reality. Seemingly very different physical systems can have a homomorphic relationship--they very often do. One of the first physics demonstrations I saw when I was young was the use of some weights and stretchy fabric to emulate gravity and orbital mechanics ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg&ab_channel=apbiolghs)). This is reasonable because the dynamics of a ball in a bowl on earth has a homomorphic relationship to orbits--they are both examples of motion in a central potential. This is an interesting mathematical exercise, but it does require a little bit of algebra, so it will be explored in its own small article.

# Homomorphic Relationships Between Emergent Systems

Now that we know what a homomorphism is, and that systems in nature can have homomorphic relationships, let's look back to an image from my [[articles/mission-statement|mission statement]]: Voronoi patterns emerging in seemingly very different situations.

![voronoi-patterns](images/voronoi-patterns.png)

The *Doing vs. Being* hypothesis is that systems that exhibit the same emergent patterns have a homomorphic relationship to one another. The parts of the system that lead to this pattern are interacting in the same way--they have the same dynamics. 

The Voronoi pattern is meant to be an illustrative example that is easy to understand, since the resemblance between these very different systems is striking, but it is also an isolated and weak case. The pattern only comes about in leaves in the sections between the structural skeleton, or only on the coat of a giraffe. This becomes more interesting and important when we look more directly at systems of competing and cooperating agents with more agency than just expanding until you reach the body of your nearest neighbor.

To say that these homomorphic relationships exist between emergent systems is to say that what makes an emergent pattern come about is not anything exclusive about the physical system, it is a product of the way the parts interact.

If we can make little robots that interact in the same way that ants do, would they self organize into structure that is equivalent to an ant colony?

# Doing vs. Being as a Method of Study

If this intuition does hold true (which I am still very skeptical of), it would greatly simplify the study of emergent systems. It would mean that any emergent system can be understood simply by finding the right set of rules that describe the way it interacts with its neighbours. If we could figure out the way that neurons interact with one another, and make a bunch of little neuronal robots, the same patterns that emerge in the brain would emerge here--or at least patterns that are described by the same dynamics. We would not need to re-engineer a neuron from scratch, only to understand the types of neurons and the way neurons interact with their neighbors.

This would effectively reduce the study of complex systems to the study of the way that agents in populations interact with one another. The study of emergent systems becomes a field that is focused on cybernetics, information theory, and game theory. 

Naturally, it would follow that simple instantiations of emergent systems can be used as models or analog computers to simulate the dynamics of much more complex systems that exhibit the same emergent patterns.

Now we have an understanding of what the *Doing vs. Being* argument is claiming. I have some real reservations that come from the way that it is a kind of [[jargon/Functionalism|functionalist perspective]]--similar to the one that inspried the language-based artificial intelligence projects of the 1980's and 1990's. The functionalist approach to artificial intelligence failed in some important ways. I'm excited to explore how these issues may affect the *Doing vs. Being* argument in an upcoming article.
