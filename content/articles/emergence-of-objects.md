title: "The Question of the Emergence of Ontologies"
---

The question that began this journey into complex systems science is a bit of strange one.

> *When I am looking at a glass on a table, there is some light that refracts off of it that just so happen to be absorbed by my eye and turned into neuronal impulses. How do these impulses turn into the thought of the object that is good at holding liquid?*


Or, more succinctly:

>What is the physical phenomena that brings about abstract thought?

  

This appears like an [[jargon/ontology|ontological]] question but it is rather the question of *the emergence of ontology itself*. This makes it not only a philosophical question, but a deep scientific question as well. 

  

As I have explored this question more and more, it has become increasingly clear that it demands a polymathic attitude. The parts are so disparite but so close. This project is meant to be a semi-formal exploration of the project of rigorously studying the emergence of ontologies. 

  

I expect I will be wrong left right and center, and that my perspective will change as more work is done and as I am able to do more of my own work. Topics will be written about and returned to. The shape of the project will ebb and flow as we explore this magical snake that eats in own tail, as she crosses through philosophy, to biology, to physics, to computation, to sociology, to the art world and beyond. 

  

  

Let's begin this journey with a discussion of the [[articles/maximally-presice-language|bounds of what we can study presicesly]].
