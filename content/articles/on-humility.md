## Why Did I Make This Site?

In the spring of 2020, I began to take the question 'how does mind emerge from matter' quite seriously. I was taking Prof. John Vervaeke's Introduction to Cognitive Science, and John is excellent at making convoluted discussions incredibly enticing. The question that was the most salient to me was not one of the necessary and sufficient conditions for mindedness, or the most simple functional form of cognition (although these are very interesting topics), it was *how mind emerges from matter.*

> There is nothing in an ant that describes the colony

The Cognitive Science program at the University of Toronto (UofT) has a very strong philosophical background and lots of support for students to explore cognition from a philosophical perspective. Professors Jim John and John Vervaeke are very approachable and very kind to their students. There is also significant access to work in artificial intelligence, as UofT is home to Geoffrey Hinton and the titanic Vector Institute. 

But my central interest was not in philosophy or in computation. My interest is motivated by questions in both fields, but I am skeptical that the answers to those questions are likely to be answered be the contemporary approaches to these fields.

My central interest seemed to be in complex systems--in [[jargon/emergence|emergent systems]]. Systems where the whole is literally greater than the sum of its parts. There is nothing in an ant alone that describes the colony. The colony only exists as it emerges out of the interaction between thousands of ants. Prof. Vervaeke especially was happy to support and encourage this approach to cognitive science papers and more philosophical writing (which I am very grateful for), but I wanted to study emergence from a more empirical perspective. 

I put quite a lot of effort into considering what field I should study in alongside cognitive science to enable me to study emergent systems with my career. For the questions that I'm interested in, the most natural choice would be biology, but the truth of [Jsomers' *I Should Have Loved Biology*](https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/) dissuaded that approach.

The most natural next choice was physics. I tended to be sympathetic to the theories of mind that modelled cognition as a dynamical system--as a series of interacting feedback loops, like [Alicia Juarrero's *Dynamics in Action*](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3793/Dynamics-in-ActionIntentional-Behavior-as-a). 
>"Unlike the processes described by classical thermodynamics, which in their relentless march towards equilibrium forget their past, complex adaptive systems are essentially historical. They embody in their very structure the conditions under which they were created (including the chance events around which each self-organized stage reorganizes). The unrepeatable, random fluctuation or perturbation around which each phase of a sequence of adaptations nucleates leaves its mark on the specific configuration that emerges." (Juarrero, 9)

Juarrero's book is really what convinced me to study physics. She was always working towards an Aristotelian metaphor for a kind of cognitive dynamics, but it was one of those theories that seem utterly obvious as the argument progresses--as if it was a tautology from its premises. I was convinced that the connection was more than metaphorical.

Two years (and some) later, and I have learned many very useful skills and very interesting concepts. My algebra is drastically improved, and I have a whole new lens of beauty for symmetry, for fluid dynamics, and for mathematical modelling in general. As thankful as I am for all of that, emergence has only ever been mentioned in my coursework once. It was with regard to the diffusion of molecules of a solute in some solvent as a collection of random walkers. Often when I mention emergence. I have struggled quite a bit to find supervisors and mentors in emperical complexity science. Of course, it is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic has also made working with external professors much more difficult.

After years of waiting, of learning and preparing to be able to empirically study the dynamics of complex systems, I have decided to make the opportunity to study these systems for myself. The purpose of this site is to house those explorations.

## On Humility
Since I am performing most of this study on my own, I need to be quite careful with regard to how I speak, as it must not be too authoritative. I will be exploring intuitions quite genuinely. I will likely find my intuitions to be incorrect, and that's a large part of the point. I want this site to be a record of my progression. I hope I often find my intuitions to be wrong, since that means I'm learning.

I think there is something very interesting that comes with developing a concept, realizing its flaws, and iterating further. This iteration is a part of the scientific process that is not often highlighted. Writing about the ways that scientists are grossly wrong 10 times before coming upon a reasonable theory. I can only aim to exemplify and encourage this kind of healthy self-skepticim.

All of this is to say that I must approach this work with humility. That around all corners, I will likely be the fool. I hope that by the end of a project, I will be less of one. But to do this, I must also write with inegrity--with a clear sense of self-skepticism, absolutely--but I must explore and write about what my genuine intuitions are, and then change my positon in lew of new evidence.

I can only hope that you, my reader, will come along for the ride--and perhaps join the discussion!
