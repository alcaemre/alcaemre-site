Sometimes I wonder what the ancient humans thought as they looked to the motions of the stars--as they told their myths of gods and heroes immortalized in the constellations. I imagine that the explanation that these lights in the sky are burning balls of gas sitting unimaginable distances away similarly unlikely to their mythologies. These people were faced with patterns they could not help but notice, but had no way to describe--and so they wondered. Time passed the the motions of the stars became less mysterious.

A part of nature that seems to remain as mysterious as it was in ancient times is the realm of [[jargon/emergence|emergence]].

This is a murmuration of starlings--a flock of little birds. Each starling is entirely unaware of the incredible geometry made by the flock's collective motion. This is emergence--a physical population where the sum is properly greater than the sum of its parts--where the collective behaves in ways that could never be found in the individuals themselves.

Emergent systems have a certain kind of intoxicating magic to them. One you are aware of their existence they become inescapable. Every living system, every mountain range, even the cracking of sand, exhibit emergent behavior. Not only that, but one seeming characteristic of emergent patterns is that they are very easy to notice, but very difficult to describe.

My interest in emergence started as a metaphysical one: [[articles/emergence-of-objects|how does abstract thought emerge from sensory information entering the brain?]]
