Hello and welcome to Emre Alca's site! 

If you are new here, I (Emre) would highly recommend you read my [[articles/mission-statement|mission statement]] so that you can have a decent idea of what I am about. To understand my approach to writing I would direct you towards my other meta-articles like [[articles/on-humility|On Humility]]. 

## Projects:
### Doing vs. Being
In Cognitive Science at least, [[jargon/Functionalism|Functionalism]] has been the stance used to define minds for a long time--that to be a mind is to be capable of what minds do. Dretske says that mind must have the capacity to represent information, but also misrepresent information. Others say that a systesm must be able to attribute mental states, or perform some judgement of relevance realization (i.e. the intelligent ignoring of the vast majority of information) to be a mind. 

[Aman Bhargava](https://aman-bhargava.com/) and I have been considering another notion: what if functionalism is looking at the problem at the wrong level. Most minds that are discussed--be that human minds, animal minds, or the collective mind of an ant colony (an example I will often use)--[[jargon/emergence|emerge]] from the interactions between large populations of discrete parts. 

The central intuition of this project is that any two systems that exhibit the same emergent behavior are comprised of parts that interact in ways that are described by analagous rules. That it is not the mental states that must have a functional lens put on them, but the neuron, or the ant.

The purpose of this project is to develop this stance, pulling from Philosophy of Mind, Mathematics and Computation, Shannon Information, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics. 

Aman and I believe that this notion holds true not only for the creation of minds, but the engineering of any [[jargon/Complex System|complex system]]. 
> Articles:
> 1. [[articles/dvb-thesis|Doing vs. Being -- Understanding the Thesis]] (October 19, 2022). Introducing the idea of the [[jargon/homomorphism|homomorphism]] between emergent systems. The same patterns are present in seemingly very distinct organisms. Could the processes that make these similar patterns be analogous to one another?
> 2. [[articles/What You Must Keep, What You May Discard|What You Must Keep, What You May Discard]] (October 28, 2022). Philosophical discussion in the cognitive sciences about the level of emergence to go about analyzing cognition. Specifically, this discussion builds up to the idea of a multileveled ontology. This paper was an assignment for PHL342: *Minds and Machines* at the University of Toronto.
